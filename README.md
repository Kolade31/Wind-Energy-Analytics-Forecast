# Renewable Energy Prediction Project
This project leverages advanced analytics and predictive modeling to forecast power generation using a fictional dataset from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The dataset features full-year hourly time-series data for a wind farm site in Texas, ensuring data completeness and minimal noise, which are common challenges in real-world forecasting.

## Objective
The primary goal is to analyze various meteorological variables and develop a model that accurately predicts power generation at specific times based on these features. By addressing the inherent variability in wind and solar conditions, the model aims to enhance grid operators' ability to manage supply and demand effectively.

## Methodology
The project involves:

Data Analysis: Exploring the dataset to identify key predictors influencing power generation.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizing machine learning techniques to create a robust model that simulates power output based on environmental variables.
Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and reliability to ensure effective forecasting.
