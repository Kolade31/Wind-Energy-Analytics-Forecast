# Wind-Energy-Analytics-Forecast
This project uses advanced analytics to predict power generation from a fictional NREL dataset for a Texas site. By analyzing meteorological variables, we aim to develop a reliable model that enhances grid operators' forecasting abilities, optimizing renewable energy integration and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
